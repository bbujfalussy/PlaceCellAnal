    "For detailed information please follow the link above. In brief, the rat was running back and forth on a linear track for reward. The activity of multiple hippocampal neurons have been recorded together with the position of the animal. \n",
    "\n",
    "The hippocampus is a brain region involved in spatial navigation. The task demands are fundementally different during movement versus immobile periods. Accordingly, the hippocampal neuronal activity is different during locomotion than during stops. Therefore the data should be analysed separately for locomotion and stops. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the original experiment neuronal activity during a short sleep episode before and after the navigation task (maze epoch) was also recorded. Here we selected data during maze epochs (no pre and post sleep). Spike times and positions have been rounded to 2 digits (10 ms and 1 cm precision). Cells have been renumbered.\n",
